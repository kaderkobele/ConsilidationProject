    ü§ñ Simulated War Card Game ü§ñ
    ====================================

    Welcome! This program simulates a game of War between two computer players:
    üñ•Ô∏è Computer 1 vs. üñ•Ô∏è Computer 2

    üîÅ How it works:
    - Each computer is dealt half of a shuffled 52-card deck (26 cards).
    - In each round, both computers automatically play their top card.
    - The computer with the higher card value wins the round and collects both cards.
    - If there is a tie, both cards are discarded.

    üèÅ Game Objective:
    - The first computer to win 10 rounds wins the simulated game.

    üìä After the game ends, you'll have the option to:
    1. Run another simulation
    2. View win statistics
    3. Exit the program

    Press ENTER to begin the simulation...
